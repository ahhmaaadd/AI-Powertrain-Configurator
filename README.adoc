# Vehicle Powertrain Design Assistant

An AI-powered tool for designing and configuring vehicle powertrains. This system integrates a Neo4j knowledge graph, OpenAI's language model, and a Streamlit-based UI to enable intelligent powertrain configuration and retrieval. It automates Cypher query generation and leverages vector-based search for enhanced retrieval capabilities.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: A chatbot to assist users in querying and designing vehicle powertrain configurations.
- **Neo4j Graph Integration**: Knowledge graph for storing powertrain component relationships and energy flows.
- **Cypher Query Automation**: Dynamically generates Cypher queries to extract relevant data.
- **Vector Search**: Embedding-based retrieval for context-aware document queries.
- **Streamlit UI**: Interactive and user-friendly web-based interface.
